SBL_rc0:
Initial Production release for first samples

SBL_v1_rc0:
- Timing issue in reset-halt
- Enable Cache
- Add pullup/pulldown for GPIO override to take care of floating pins
- Changes in error handling if Crypto is inaccessible for some reason

SBL_v1.1_rc0:
- Bug fix for Fastboot
- Add support for Key revocation
- RMA exception mode support
- Letting normal processing resume after OVERRIDE, if the host never connects

SBL_v2.1:
- Bug fixes in RMA exception mode handling
- Stronger pull up for GPIO Override
- Using higher timeout of 10s in the RMA override case

SBL_v3.0:
- Add graceful sequencing for Crypto power down and POI
- Add checks in SBL for Content Cert verification
- Secure OTA – add check to fail Authentication if not in SecureBoot mode (as there is no valid cert chain)
- Tested Cert Chain update OTA – and fixed issues discovered
- Trim patch support
- Added new feature to allow MRAM protection attributes to be specified in the Content Cert Image record
- Updated code to not enable cache for security reasons
- Numerous optimizations in code as well as logging messages

SBL_v5_rc0: 
- Workaround for issues related to Crypto and MRAM interactions
- Added Reset of MCUCTRL DEBUGGER lockouts in SBL at the beginning
- RMA Exception processing needed only for partial RMA state
- Fixed the broken SBL OTA over wired interface
- Fix INFO0 Update via SBL
- Added some delays before reset to allow logs to flush out
- Added protective check in the Secure Firmware OTA to make sure Content Cert version matches
- Bug fix to OEM keyrevoke update
- Added code to disable HW key masking
- Changes to overcome limitation of <64K for SHA and AES functions

SBL_v6_rc1:
- Bug fixes:
  - Fix in the INFO read workaround
  - Fix clearing of original ResetStat if subjected to SBL OTA
  - Moved MCUCTRL_DEBUGGER setting to the end of processing, as otherwise we might lock ourselves out (e.g. if SWO is disabled).
- Diagnostic enhancements:
  - Dump additional diagnostics from SBR (only applicable to SBRv5 onwards)
  - Additional diagnostic prints for the ARM lib error codes
- Functional Changes
  - Change extreme locking on error conditions to allow the chip to boot back to SBL. Also it would allow error recovery if there is an SD cert preinstalled.
  - Change to use SNVR3 instead of INFO1 to store resetStatus. 
    This makes SBLv6 incompatible with previous versions - and hence needs a corresponding SDK HAL change
