**********************************************************************************************
18Jul2023 Revision release_sdk_4_4_1-7498c7b770

This is a combined release supporting updates to Apollo4/Apollo4 Blue RevB2 with an updated
release of Apollo4 Plus/Apollo4 Blue Plus Rev C0 (KBR and KXR devices). This also includes the
initial release of Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite with updated project device targets.

**********************************************************************************************

SDK supports all Apollo4 evaluation boards from Ambiq.
- Apollo4b EVB (/boards/apollo4b_evb)
- Apollo4b Blue EVB (/boards/apollo4b_blue_evb)
- Apollo4b EVB with Rev 1 Display Shield (/boards/apollo4b_evb_disp_shield)
- Apollo4l EVB (/boards/apollo4l_evb) (NEW)
- Apollo4l Blue EVB (/boards/apollo4l_blue_evb) (NEW)
- Apollo4p EVB (/boards/apollo4p_evb)
- Apollo4p Blue KBR EVB (/boards/apollo4p_blue_kbr_evb)
- Apollo4p Blue KXR EVB (/boards/apollo4p_blue_kxr_evb)
- Apollo4p EVB with Rev 2 Display Shield (/boards/apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev2)

SDK includes a number of predefined examples for each configuration. See the file in /docs/List_of_Examples.txt. 

SDK includes pre-built graphics examples using the Embedded Wizard (Tara Systems) GUI-Builder tool. These can be 
found at boards/apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev2/examples/graphics.  Support for this tool can be found at:
https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/getting-started-apollo4-display-kit?v=11.00

IDE/ToolChain Support:
----------------------
AmbiqSuite SDK supports GCC, IAR and Keil IDEs.
This release has been tested with:
- GCC 10.3.1 20210621 (release) [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 10.3-2021.07]
- IAR ANSI C/C++ Compiler V9.20.2.320/W64 for ARM
- Keil: ARMCC 5060750, ARM Compiler 5.06 update 6 (build 750)
- Keil: V5.36.0.0 ArmClang V6.16 (GCC Clang 13.0.0)

* For IAR EWARM, Apollo4 is natively supported with EWARM v9.10.2 and later. Apollo4 Plus is natively supported
  in v9.32.1 or later. 
* For EWARM version v9.40.1 it was observed that the project files will need to be updated via Embedded Workbench 
  IDE before command-line make/clean will work. Due to this, there will be a warning message from IAR.
  - "Device config file: $TOOLKIT_DIR$\config\devices\default.i79 not found"
  - You will receive this message before every conversion. This only happens on the conversion process. 
    The file is indeed there and there are no issues with continuing after project file conversion.
    If you save as 9.40.1 project file, the error message will no longer occur when opening that project file.
* For Keil MDK, Apollo4 is supported by installing the CMSIS Ambiq Pack v1.2.9 or later. Apollo4 Plus is supported in
  v1.3.0. The latest Ambiq pack should be available via the MDK Pack Installer utility. CMSIS Ambiq Pack v1.4.0
  includes Apollo4 Lite support and is included in this release. Please see the instructions provided in 
  the /debugger_updates/ directory.
* It is expected that J-Link and IAR will soon natively support Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite
  devices. In the interim, tools patches to support Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite are provided with 
  this release. Please see the instructions provided in the /debugger_updates/ directory.
* By default, Apollo4 Plus projects in this release select the AMAP42KP-KBR device. Other
  Apollo4 Plus devices are also supported.
* By default, Apollo4 Lite projects in this release select the AMAP42KL-KBR device. The Apollo4 Blue Lite 
  device is also supported.

Notes:
------
* Provisioning and image tools for Apollo4 Plus and Apollo4 Blue Plus use the same infrastructure as Apollo4.
  Use tools/apollo4b_scripts for the same.
* Apollo4 Lite and Apollo4 Blue Lite use the provisioning and image tools in tools/apollo4l_scripts folder.
  
Known Issues:
-------------
* The tempco example is incompatible with some Apollo4p EVBs which contain earlier trim revision devices. Trim revision 6 or later is required.
* The Power examples for Apollo4p EVBs will also result in sub-optimal power performance unless trim revision 6 or later devices are used.
